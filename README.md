# SQL-in-Bigquery_Website-Performance-Analysis
I. Introduction
In this project, I applied advanced SQL techniques, including sliding window and aggregation queries, using Google BigQuery to analyze e-commerce data. I evaluated product performance, sales trends, discount strategies, customer retention, and inventory management. These insights supported the Marketing and Sales teams in making strategic, data-driven decisions to improve business outcomes.

II. Dataset Access
The e-commerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:

Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".
Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" and click "Enter".
Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it.
III. Key Focus Areas
Product Performance Analysis: Evaluated subcategory performance through sales metrics and year-over-year growth rates.
Geographic Sales Patterns: Identified top-performing territories by order quantity across multiple years.
Discount Strategy Assessment: Analyzed seasonal discount costs across product subcategories.
