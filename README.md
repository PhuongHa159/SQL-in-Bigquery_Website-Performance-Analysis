# SQL-in-Bigquery_Website-Performance-Analysis
## I. Introduction
In this project, I applied advanced SQL techniques, including sliding window and aggregation queries, using Google BigQuery to analyze e-commerce data. I evaluated product performance, sales trends, discount strategies, customer retention, and inventory management. These insights supported the Marketing and Sales teams in making strategic, data-driven decisions to improve business outcomes.

## II. Dataset Access
The e-commerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:

* Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
* In the navigation panel, search for the "ga_session" dataset and open it in new tab
## III. Key Focus Areas
Product Performance Analysis: Evaluated subcategory performance through sales metrics and year-over-year growth rates.
Geographic Sales Patterns: Identified top-performing territories by order quantity across multiple years.
Discount Strategy Assessment: Analyzed seasonal discount costs across product subcategories.
Customer Retention Analysis: Calculated retention rates for successfully shipped orders using cohort analysis.
Inventory Management: Examined stock level trends, month-over-month changes, and stock-to-sales ratios.
Order Status Monitoring: Quantified pending orders and their value to assess fulfillment efficiency.
